The theme that we are doing on is open house and our aim is to make open house fun for people. What makes our project stands out is because it is not common in the open houses that have occurred. In the website, there is pages which introduces what will happen during the open house, which includes the NP Open House App. The uses gamification so it will be well-liked by teenagers which are our target audiences for the NP Open House. There is also different functions which would cater to various people thus increasng its usage by people. In he website, it is very convient for people to use and also some interactive designs for them to explore. 

# Design Process
This website is mainly for people going for Ngee Ann Poly Open House which are secondary school and ITE students. These people uses the website to look out for what actvities and plans are going to occur during the Open House. And because they are new to the school, they would need to know more about it like the courses and directions. 
-As a secondary school and ITE student, I would want to have a glance of what will be happening at the event and at what time of day it will occur so that I can arrange my schedule and reach at the correct timing. And also, only go for talks and activites that I am interested in.
-As a new visitor to the school, I would want to know how to reach the school to attend the open house so that I do not get lost and waste time finding the way. 
-As a secondary school and ITE student, I would want to know why I should choose Ngee Ann Poly as my choice and what interesting things are there as compared to other schools so that I can decide on which school to go to. 
-As a secondary school and ITE student, I would want to know what is so special in the open house as compared to other schools as that I would want to travel over to have the experience.
